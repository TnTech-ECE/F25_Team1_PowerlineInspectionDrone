## Meeting Minutes (Summary)
Entire focus of the meeting was to pitch our idea to our customer and seek general approval before submitting detialed design for official approval.
Concept was received well and tons of useful information was given to the team. Decided to use drones located on campus for ease of work as the team can reliably
test on them consistently. Last key point is customer reccomended to buy cheaper batteries and the scale calculations with battery size until it fits the drone.
Some will likelhy be failures in the design process and this idea will save the group money before we are certain our design works without error.


## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Complete all tasks assigned relative to each section in detailed design and submit for approval early in the week.
