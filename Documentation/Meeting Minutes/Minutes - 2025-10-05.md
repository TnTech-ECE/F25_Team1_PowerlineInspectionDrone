## Meeting Minutes (Summary)

Discussed next phase with advisor and got suggestions for specific designs to test in the lab. Two members were unable to make the meeting but
were informed through team communication methods about topics discussed. The team was given contact for who to reach out to about the lab if emails are
not responded too and discussed the best time being right after the conclusion of fall break but will do during if absolutely necessary. This needs to be
completed to determine the specific direction for the future of the project.

## Action Items for Next Week

For the Team: 1. Finalize a date and run tests in the transformer lab as a team.
