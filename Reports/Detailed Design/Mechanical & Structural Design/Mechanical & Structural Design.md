# Mechanical and Structural Detailed Design

## Function of the Subsystem
The Mechanical and Structural subsystem design for the Arc Angel drone implementation includes 
housing for all of the other subsystems including: Battery Safety and BMS Design, Control and 
Communication Design, Corona Detection and Camera Sensing, and the Power Harvesting and Charging
Design. 

The Structural Design function will need to effectively house all of the components internally.
This will be achieved by having casings to give structural support to all the subsystems in the
housing undercarriage shown in Figures [LIST WHEN CREATED] below. A major confrontation to the
Structural Design is the weight distribution and mass of the housing. It will ensure that
the subsystems housed will not have any displacement from original placement realitive to the 
housing design. The Structural Design shall also not severely effect drone flight, the system
will use major fluid mechanic design and weight distribution to keep flight efficiency as a top
priority.


The Mechanical Design lies mostly in the connection from the Housing and Harvesting Designs
to the power lines that the entire system will be designed around. It ensures safety and opperational
ease in attachment and deattachment from power lines. Once set in a need of charge state, the 
Mechanical Design will communicate with the Control Design to raise and lower an arm on the above
drone housing system that will hook onto the power line. This hook, listed in Figures [LIST WHEN
CREATED] will provide connection from the line to the Power Harvesting and Charging Subsystem.

## Specification and Constraints
- The Structural Design subsystem shall not affect drone flight or stability.
- The Structural Design subsystem shall be stable and not be affected by weather.
- The Structural and Mechanical design should interface with all other subsystems when needed.
- The Mechanical Design subsystem shall be a stable connection to the power line.
- The Mechanical Design subsystem shall operate around a linear axis scale and not affect drone flight.
## Overview of Proposed Solutions
This system includes the following devices and material:
- LW-PLA: Light weight, stable material for Structural and Mechanical subsystem.
- MG90S Mini Gear Servo: Lightweight, low gear 180 degree servo motor for hook-to-line connection.
- Dome Undercarriage Housing: Aerodynamic, larger space housing for all other subsystems.
- Linear Axis Hook: Efficient and stable connection for line-to-harvesting connection.
- Two Claw Hook: Provides stability from drone-to-line connection.
- Housing to Drone Connection: Screw housing to drone leg connection to provide stability and simplicity for housing.
