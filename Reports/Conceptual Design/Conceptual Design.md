### Budget

The total estimated budget for this project is approximately $640, which covers the essential components needed to build a functional prototype drone housing for transmission line inspection. This includes the drone platform, basic sensors, onboard computing,  spare batteries, and components required for charging off of a transmission line. The budget is kept intentionally low by leveraging school-provided lab equipment and low-cost commercial parts.

### Timeline

![Gantt Chart](ArcAngel%20Gantt%20Chart.png)

The capstone team has one academic year to design and develop a drone housing for power line inspection. The drone will be capable of detecting excessive corona discharge and will also incorporate a system to recharge from the transmission line.

In the first semester, the focus will be on defining the project scope, breaking it into smaller tasks, and beginning the design process.

During the second semester, the team will refine the prototype, finalize parts and specifications, and move into system integration. The final phase includes building, testing, troubleshooting, and validating the completed drone.

If the team follows the schedule outlined in the Gantt chart, the project will result in a fully functional inspection drone by May 2026.
